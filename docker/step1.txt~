here we will explore docker further
we will use the ubuntu image hosted on docker repositories


1) sudo docker info 
if docker daemon is running then u get a bunch of information

if not 
sudo start docker

2) launching/creating our first ubuntu container

sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bash/bin

3) from another terminal type, its gives us the containers that are running 

sudo docker jps


4) typing exit on the bash/bin will stop the container
