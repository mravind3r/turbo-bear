1) update the repository
 what we are doing here is redirecting the output to /docker.list
 after u run this command , you can cat /docker.list

sudo sh -c "echo deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"


2) install curl is not available


3) Now get the GPG verification key

curl -s https://get.docker.io/gpg | sudo apt-key add -


4) sudo apt-get update 

this will look at /docker.list and update the apt sources list available


5) install docker

sudo apt-get install lxc-docker


6) to check if docker daemon is running , as soon as the package is installed docker daemon runs, 
to change the port where the daemon is listening google it.

sudo docker info 


Note: In companies this may not work due to firewalls etc.
In Ubuntu if you use the UWF ie uncomplicated firewall then some seting have to be changed to get Docker work with Ubuntu

Docker works with network bridge to manage networking on your computers, by default UFW drops all forwarded packets.You need to enable forwarding by editing /etc/default/uwf   file.

set DEFAULT_FOWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"

save the file and reload

sudo uwf reload




7) to check status of docker daemon

sudo status docker

8) to stop docker

sudo stop docker
sudo start docker



9) to copy files from host to docker

$docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES

d8e703d7e303 solidleon/ssh:latest /usr/sbin/sshd -D cranky_pare

$docker inspect -f '{{.Id}}' cranky_pare
